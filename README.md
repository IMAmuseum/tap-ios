Tap iOS (iPhone & iPod)
--------
<br>
The TAP iOS application provides a keypad based navigation experience for <a href="http://www.tapintomuseums.org/tourml">TourML</a>. For help setting up the iOS application please visit our <a href="https://github.com/IMAmuseum/tap-ios/wiki">wiki</a>. Further information about the TAP project can also be found at <a href="http://www.tapintomuseums.org">tapintomuseums.org</a>. 

Before running the application, it is assumed you have already created a tour in the <a href="https://github.com/IMAmuseum/tap-cms">CMS</a> and exported a tour.

**NOTE**: You will NOT be able to install the application on a device without a $99 <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/">iPhone developer account</a>. These instructions will allow you to run the app in the iPhone simulator on a Mac.
